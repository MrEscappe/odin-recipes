    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A traditional favorite in my family, Brazilian carrot cake is very different from the American version.

    </p>
    <p> The
        popular cake is topped with homemade chocolate frosting, and perfect to serve with a glass of milk or tea.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large carrots, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup cooking oil</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter or margarine</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup instant hot chocolate mix</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 9x13 baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the carrots, eggs, and oil in a blender or bowl of a food processor. Process until carrots are finely chopped. Pour the carrot mixture into a mixing bowl. Stir in 2 cups sugar until well blended. Stir in the flour and baking powder; mix until well blended. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in preheated oven until top springs back when lightly touched, about 40 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, make the icing by placing the butter, 1 cup sugar, instant hot chocolate drink mix, and milk in a pan. While stirring, heat to almost boiling over medium-high heat until mixture thickens. When the cake is done, remove from the oven and immediately spread the icing evenly over the top.
