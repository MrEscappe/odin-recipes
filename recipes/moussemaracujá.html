		<img src="/img/moussemaracuja.webp" alt="mousse Brazilian dish" />
		<p>
			This is Brazilian favorite (and an old family recipe), and takes no cooking at all. It's a little tart and tangy for those of you who
			don't like your desserts to be too sweet.

		<h2>Steps</h2>

			<li>
				Break passion fruits in half, and empty contents into a bowl. Use a little water to help rinse the juice out of the skins. Mix with
				hands to soften pulp. Strain through a sieve or cheesecloth. Stir in sugar and sweetened condensed milk.

			<li>
				In a chilled bowl, beat cream until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the cream into the passion fruit mixture, then quickly fold in
				remaining cream until no streaks remain. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
